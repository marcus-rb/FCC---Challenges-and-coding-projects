# FCC - Challenges and coding projects
Code solutions for FreeCodeCamp I am especially pleased with, either for being superneat or superadvanced (at least in my opinion)

Feel free to use in your projects if you feel it has some purpose, in that case I would highly appreciate that you credit me.

Please note that directly copying the solutions I provide here and using them for your own certificate on FCC is a direct
violation of the FreeCodeCamp Academic Honesty Agreement
