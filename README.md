# FCC-Intermediate-Algorithmic-Challenges
Code solutions for FreeCodeCamp I am especially pleased with, either for being superneat or superadvanced

Feel free to use in your projects if you feel it has some purpose, in that case I would highly appreciate that you credit me.

Please note that directly copying the solutions I provide here and using them for your own certificate on FCC is a direct
violation of the FreeCodeCamp Academic Honesty Agreement
